# Making your research project outputs Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)

Welcome to the [Neuromatch Academy](https://neuromatch.io/computational-neuroscience-course/)! As you develop your computational neuroscience skills, we want to help you build habits for sharing your work openly and making it discoverable. This guide introduces the essentials of FAIR research workflows using persistent identifiers.

## Why FAIR workflows matter

Making your research outputs FAIR benefits you and the broader community in three key ways:

- **Collaboration**: Sharing work, processes, and results enables others to build on your contributions
- **Crediting**: Properly identified outputs ensure you receive recognition for all stages of your research
- **Compliance**: Planning with FAIR principles helps meet funder and institutional requirements

For the full FAIR principles, see [GO-FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

## The building blocks: Persistent identifiers

Persistent identifiers (PIDs) and the metadata associated with them are the foundation of FAIR research. The PID infrastructure facilitates permanent, unique references that connect researchers, organizations, and outputs ([Meadows et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1629/uksg.457)).

### ORCID (for researchers)

Your unique researcher identifier that links you to all your outputs.

- **Action**: Create and authenticate your ORCID at [orcid.org](https://orcid.org) if you don't already have one, and use it whenever you share outputs
- **Why it matters**: When you attach your ORCID to publications, datasets, and code, they become permanently linked to you

### DOI (for outputs)

A permanent identifier for research objects—datasets, code, protocols, preprints, and more.

- **Where you get them**: Automatically assigned when you share via platforms like Zenodo, OSF, or data repositories
- **Why it matters**: Makes your work citable and trackable across the scholarly record ([Cousijn et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2020.100180))

### ROR (for organizations)

Registry identifiers that connect organizations to researchers and outputs.

- **Action**: Look up your institution at [ror.org](https://ror.org), and use it when depositing outputs
- **Why it matters**: Links your work to affiliations and funders unambiguously

The open PIDs are designed to work together seamlessly. For example, when you share a dataset on Zenodo, you can link it to your ORCID and your institution's ROR ID, as well as the DOIs of other upstream resources that are related to it, creating a rich web of connections that enhance discoverability, reproducibility, and fair attribution of credits.


## Practical steps to get started

1. **Create a data management plan** to outline how you'll make your research FAIR at each stage (planning, data collection, analysis, sharing)
2. **Link your ORCID** to your institutional systems and publishing platforms
3. **Bookmark key platforms**: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), [OSF](https://osf.io), [protocols.io](https://protocols.io)
4. **Review the [Guide for Researchers](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11355855)** for detailed (and printable) checklist at each research stage

### Sharing your course outputs

The tutorials you complete in this course produce real research artifacts—treat them as practice for sharing your actual research outputs:

- **Code & notebooks**: Share your completed Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks from W0D1-W0D5 via Zenodo or GitHub with Zenodo integration
- **Simulation data**: Your LIF neuron simulations and statistical analyses can be deposited with DOIs
- **Visualizations**: Plots like membrane potential curves, vector diagrams, and statistical distributions can be shared as supplementary materials
- **Analysis workflows**: Document your computational environment and parameters for reproducibility

## Recommended tools and platforms

| Platform | Use case | Link |
|----------|----------|------|
| Zenodo | General output sharing (datasets, code, presentations) | [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org) |
| OSF | Project management, preregistration | [osf.io](https://osf.io) |
| protocols.io | Experimental protocols | [protocols.io](https://protocols.io) |
| OpenNeuro | Neuroscience datasets | [openneuro.org](https://openneuro.org) |
| brainlife.io | Neuroscience analysis pipelines | [brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io) ([Hayashi et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02237-2)) |
